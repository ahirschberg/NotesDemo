# NotesDemo
Repository for the Firefox OS Notes App for use in the National Day of Civic Hacking Presentation.

There is a live demo of this app [here](http://students.gctaa.net/~ahirschberg/NotesDemo/notesdemo/).  In its current state, it's a pure HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript app and should run in any modern browser, although it is built with Firefox OS in mind.
